## Wikipedia Need Help

Please don't scroll past this 1-minute read. I'm sorry to interrupt, but it's Saturday, November 18, and you only had a 10% chance of seeing this message. I ask you to reflect on the number of times you visited Wikipedia in the past year, the value you got from it, and whether you're able to give $3 to the Wikimedia Foundation. If you can, please join the 2% of readers who give. If everyone reading this right now gave just $3, we'd hit our goal in a couple of hours.

Wikipedia is not perfect, but also not here to make a profit or to push a particular perspective. It is written by everyone, together. We want everyone to have equal access to high-quality information – something that is hard to find online.

If Wikipedia has given you $3 worth of knowledge this year, please give back. There are no small contributions: every edit counts, every donation counts. Thank you.
